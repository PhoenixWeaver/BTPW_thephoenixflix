The homepage is now more dynamic than ever. Both the "This Week's Top Movies" and "Something to Watch Today" sections now feature their own independent **Era Filter Dropdowns**.

*   **Independent Filtering:** Users can set a different era for each section (e.g., view top movies from the 1990s and get a random movie suggestion from the 2020s).
*   **Full Time-Travel:** The dropdowns provide a full range of options, from the 1980s to the present, in 5-year increments, plus an "All Time" option.
*   **Seamless Integration:** When an era is selected, the movie list in that section instantly updates to reflect the choice without a page reload.
